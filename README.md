🌱 ProjectFarmCapiz

ProjectFarmCapiz is an initiative of the Capiz Innovation Center (CIC) to digitize farming practices across the province.
Our goal is to empower farmers and farm owners with affordable, low-maintenance, long-range sensors that feed real-time data into a centralized database. This data powers dashboards and condition alerts, enabling smarter decisions on labor allocation, resource use, and farm management.

🚜 Vision

- Make farming data-driven and accessible for smallholders and MSMEs.
- Reduce costs through low-power, long-range sensor networks.
- Improve productivity and resilience by providing timely alerts and actionable insights.

🔧 Core Components

- Sensor Design: Low-cost, durable, long-range devices for field deployment.
- Data Pipeline: Secure collection and storage of farm condition metrics.
- Dashboards: Visual tools for monitoring, alerts, and decision support.

📊 Expected Outcomes

- Better labor allocation through real-time condition monitoring.
- Increased farm efficiency and reduced losses.
- A scalable model for digital agriculture in Capiz and beyond.
